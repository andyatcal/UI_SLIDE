PLAN: 

June 8th 2015

Mimick Perry_Tetra4_offset.slf to get the subdivision of continuum.

1. READ Perry_Tetra4_offset.slf and find how does it work.

2. Subdivide one of the six parts of continuum.

2.1 Find the points
2.2 Write subdivision code
2.3 Find how to mirror them to other 5 parts
2.4 Does it have the mobius issue?

3. Send a screenshot to Prof. CHS

Feedback from Prof.CHS June 8th 2015

Problems;
1) After rotation, the six parts are NOT connected. I wonder if we should make some quads connects those parts together.
2) Doesn't quite  look like Continuum... The width of the band/ribbons is two large. A decrease of "outer radius" make it look a bit better.

>>> The problem is that you connected the rims in the wrong way. You should stay within the same color of the 3 rim segments in the same sector.
There is a single branch coming from the center, which then splits outwards into two branches that connect to the neighboring sectors.
The first slider: "width saddle ribbon" should properly affect the width of the ribbon (in direct proportion).
There the connection between the 2nd-last B-spline points should be the same for the branches that are supposed to fuse there.

look at the pictures in my Bridges paper again.

ME:

I got it wrong on the points of the left and right branches, need to rebuild the front and back.

New problem occur: the six parts still do not connect.

Plan:

1st: ADD extra quads from bspline;
2nd: ADD dummy quads from bspline;

Feedback from Prof. CHS:

>>>  You need to combine the quadmeshes of the sectors BEFORE doing the subdivision, or the edges will already have been rounded and shrunk.
>>>  fixed example:   "Continuum_subdiv_six_sectors__combined.slf"

>>>  This works for the outer segment connections.

>>> In the center, the ribbons don't fuse, because they really do not come together.
>>> If you look at Perry's sculpture, you can see that there is a "Monkey-saddle" there.
>>> To make properly connected polyhedral saddle, we must add a horizontal hexagon.
>>> Then we run into the reversed-side problem.
>>> To fix that we use the back-surfaces for the lower half of the sculpture.
>>> So now the saddle works, -- but there is trouble at the outer segment connections!  :-(
>>> See:  "Continuum_subdiv_six_sectors__saddle.slf"

>>> To get to a solution for both problems, we judiciously combine front and back surfaces,
>>> so we get a properly connected double coverage everywhere; -- a nice challenge.
