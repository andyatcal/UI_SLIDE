1. Possiblities of Tcl/Tk in the UI of SLIDE:
"Because the SLIDE dynamics scripting language is Tcl, it is also possible for designers to call apon the rich set of graphic UI widgets presented by Tk during the initialization phase of their SLIDE description."

"Using Tcl's ability to link Tcl procedure names to C or C++ procedures created by developers, SLIDE is able to provide a Tcl interface to the SLIDE geometry parser."

Since SLIDE works as a Tcl interface, it make sense to use Tcl UI widgets to customize SLIDE UI.

2. Existing UIs in SLIDE: 
"There is a user interface known as the "crystal ball interface" that allows the user to rotate their object so that they can view it from any arbitrary angle."

Some existing UIs are defined in SLIDEUI.tcl. It comprises Buttons, Frames (for LOD/Shading/Solid/LightType/Projection), Creations (objects/instances/etc)

We can switch between the camera mode and selection mode. Take IcosaGen.slf for example. 

In camera mode:
CAD: The cursor "crystal ball interface" rotate the position of camera
EXPLORE: The cursor translate the postion of camera
FLY: Left click, zoom in. Right click, zoom out.

In selection mode:
An element can be 1) selected 2) display the name in terminal 3) show the x,y,z axis and 4) Translate elements by draging.

The viewport can be scaled by draging the frame of displaying window.

(BUG REPORT: Shift + left click will result in missing elements)


3. Jordan's UI idea for SLIDE:
"For now it is more of a programmers interface for generating geometry. In the future, it would be nice to have an incremental drag and drop interface for creating additional geometry."
